LT-04 Usage by Category (Design Spec),"This report can be displayed to the user whenever they visit a usage dashboard. Unless they explicitly opt out of seeing the insight, it will continue to offer value in an on-demand context.
It may also be served to the user triggered by some passage of time. For example, a monthly email digest.
Separate insights should be produced for each product.
May be helpful to Admins to see time spent for users they manage. (Account Management Portal)",as a digest on demand (can possibly work with account portal mvp),,50/100,36/100,0,5,0,1,3,1.8
LT-06 Update Recommendation by Command Name,"Note: Recommendations are currently based off of command usage, not by Category or Feature. 
We need to consider adding the ability to Recommend based on Category as well.  This would make sense for things like Block changes and Quick Measure.","as a digest on demand 
Should guide user to complete the update workflow via desktop app or direct download",,50/100,40/100,4,2,1,0,3,2
LT-07 Frustration Detection Tip,"Pick top 10 commands that are susceptible to this pattern (based on past usage analysis).
Real-time delivery in DWG context is beneficial for this insight.
This may be valuable in AutoCAD web vs. Account management portal.",,,50/100,64/100,6,3,2,2,3,3.2
LT-08 Update Recommendation General,"May already be handled by Desktop App
Should only be displayed if there are no more specific LT-06 insights available for the user",,,50/100,32/100,4,1,0,0,3,1.6

HP-03A - Application Performance Report,"We noticed:
Chart system performance (regen rate, memory usage, file open times, etc.) against drawing details (objects, blocks, sheets, X-Refs, etc.)
We recommend:
User can identify drawing files that are correlated to performance problems.
Notes:
""EG. jp- we noticed that your machine slows on selection of lots of objects you may need to limit the number of grip (sysvar name)
EG. We notice that you are trying to reference file x from slow network share y. You may want to remove this reference or copy the file locally to improve your file open performance.
EG. (SMP) We noticed this entity is significantly larger than we'd typically expect, consider these options to improve it and the performance of the DWG",,,50/100,52/100,2,5,1,2,3,2.6
